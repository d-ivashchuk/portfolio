# React-portfolio

Working demo on https://d-ivashchuk.github.io/portfolio/

This portfolio is built with `react` and `styled-components`. If you want to play with it, clone the repo, run `npm install` command in your terminal and run `npm start`. As this portfolio uses `create-react-app` a new browser window with an app running on local server will open and any changes to the code will trigger hot reload of the page.
